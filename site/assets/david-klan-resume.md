**Curiosity-driven builder exploring how AI can help people do meaningful work**

## About Me

I've always been the person who asks "why?" and "what if?" — not to be difficult, but because I genuinely want to understand how things work and how they could work better.

For the past 15+ years, I've been building things that solve real problems for people. From helping insurance companies move thousands of records safely, to creating AI tools that help tax professionals find answers faster, I've learned that the most rewarding work happens when you truly understand what someone needs.

I believe in learning by doing. I don't just read about new technologies — I build with them, break them, figure out what they're actually good at, and then share what I've learned.

**What I'm curious about right now:**
- How AI can help experts do their work better (not replace them)
- Building systems that people actually enjoy using
- Finding the balance between what's possible and what's practical
- Creating tools that respect human expertise while amplifying it

## Things I've Built

### Japanese Tax Expert System (JTES)
**Helping tax professionals find answers they can trust**

When I started learning about retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), I wanted to build something that solved a real problem, not just a demo. I noticed that tax professionals in Japan spend hours searching through complex regulations, often without clear citations or sources.

So I built JTES — an AI assistant that:
- Finds relevant tax information and always shows where it came from
- Uses the way tax professionals actually think about problems (not just keyword matching)
- Explains things clearly while staying accurate

**What I learned:** The best AI systems aren't about showing off how smart the model is — they're about understanding what the person using it actually needs to be successful.

### Insurance Reporting & Incident Intelligence
**Making complex workflows less painful**

I worked with an insurance team that was drowning in repetitive reporting tasks. Analysts were spending hours preparing the same reports every week, and incident triage was inconsistent because everyone did it differently.

Together, we built tools that:
- Automate the boring parts of reporting so analysts can focus on the interesting stuff
- Standardize how incidents are triaged, making handoffs smoother
- Let the AI handle the pattern recognition while humans make the judgments

**What I learned:** People don't want "AI" — they want their work to be less annoying. When you remove the friction, amazing things happen.

### Receipt Classification & Matching System
**Making reconciliation a little less painful**

I built a system that helps finance teams organize receipts by reading them, figuring out what they're for, and matching them to the right accounts. It uses a combination of straightforward rules and machine learning to make the process faster and more consistent.

**What I learned:** Sometimes the smartest solution is the simplest one. You don't always need the newest tech — you just need to solve the right problem.

## Work I'm Proud Of

### Enterprise Data Migration (AIG / Smart Partners)
**Moving thousands of records without losing anyone's important data**

I led a team that migrated data from legacy systems to new platforms as part of a mainframe sunset. The stakes were high — these were real customer records, real financial data, and people's livelihoods depended on everything being correct.

We built governance workflows, created risk-based reporting, and most importantly, we made sure that zero critical data was lost during the transition.

**What I'm proud of:** We didn't just move data — we built trust. The stakeholders knew we cared about getting it right.

### Infrastructure Transformation at Scale (AXA / Smart Partners)
**Coordinating work across continents**

I've led infrastructure refresh programs that touched thousands of devices and hundreds of servers across Japan, Europe, and North America. After a major merger, I helped standardize systems and implement disaster recovery plans that would protect the business if something went wrong.

**What I'm proud of:** Getting people in different time zones, with different priorities, to all row in the same direction. That's not technical work — that's people work.

---

### Change Leadership & Enablement
**Helping organizations through transformation**

One thing I've learned over and over: the technology is usually the easy part. The hard part is helping people understand why change matters, what's in it for them, and how they'll succeed in the new way of doing things.

I've created governance frameworks, led steering committees, managed stakeholders, and built communication plans — not because I love process, but because it helps real people do real work.

**What I'm proud of:** When someone tells me "I actually get it now" or "I can do my job better because of this."

## What I Bring to a Team

**Learning mindset:** I'm not afraid to say "I don't know, let's figure it out." I've learned more from problems that stumped me than from things that were easy.

**Respect for expertise:** I don't believe AI replaces humans — I believe it helps experts do what they do best. I've worked with tax pros, engineers, analysts, and executives, and I always start by listening to what they actually need.

**Building for real people:** I've seen too many systems that look great in demos but fail in real life. I care about whether something actually works for the person who has to use it every day.

**Cross-cultural perspective:** Living and working in Japan has taught me that the best ideas come from diverse viewpoints. I speak Japanese at a business level and I'm comfortable working across cultures.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm open to full-time roles, consulting, or advisory work. What matters most to me:

1. **Meaningful problems:** I want to work on things that actually matter to someone, not just more features nobody needs.

2. **Room to learn:** If I'm not learning something new, I'm probably not growing. I want to work with people who challenge me.

3. **Respect for craft:** Teams that care about quality, not just shipping. That means thinking about the user, the maintainers, and the long-term impact.

4. **Autonomy with accountability:** I want the freedom to figure things out, but I also believe in owning the outcome.
