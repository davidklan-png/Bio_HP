# Data Notes

Store small, non-sensitive sample datasets used by notebook demos.

Suggested files:
- `support_tickets_sample.csv`
- `rfp_questions_sample.csv`

Do not commit proprietary or personally identifiable information.

## Agent Handover Notes (2026-02-13)

- Use only anonymized, minimal sample data for demos.
- Keep file sizes small enough for quick notebook execution in local environments.
- Document schema assumptions in each notebook that consumes these files.
