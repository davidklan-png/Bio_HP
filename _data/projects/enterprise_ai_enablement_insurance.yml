name: Enterprise AI Enablement in Insurance – Reporting & Incident Intelligence
one_line_value: Automated reporting and incident intelligence to improve executive visibility and Change Management decisions.
icon: insurance
tags:
  - Enterprise Automation
  - Incident Intelligence
  - Executive Reporting
impact_bullets:
  - Automated PM reporting and executive dashboard workflows.
  - Unified insights across Confluence, Jira, SharePoint, Power Automate, and Power BI.
  - Added coding-agent parsers for hundreds of MB of incident data trend analysis.
executive_summary:
  problem: PM reporting and incident trend analysis were fragmented across enterprise tools, limiting executive visibility and slowing Change Management response.
  solution: Automated reporting pipelines and built executive dashboards, then introduced bespoke parser workflows (with coding agents) to analyze large incident datasets.
  outcome: Improved reporting cadence, clearer incident trend signals, and stronger evidence for Change Management decisions.
use_case:
  summary: Insurance leadership needed reliable, cross-system intelligence for delivery status, incident patterns, and operational risk.
  stakeholders:
    - Executive leadership
    - Program and project managers
    - Change Management and incident response teams
architecture:
  overview: Operational data from collaboration and ticketing systems is transformed into dashboard-ready metrics, with parser pipelines for deep incident trend extraction.

tech_details:
  rag_prompt_patterns:
    - Structured summarization prompts for status rollups.
    - Parser-assisted analysis prompts for incident clustering.
    - Executive-tailored narrative templates for dashboard briefings.
  tools:
    - Confluence, Jira, SharePoint
    - Power Automate and Power BI
    - Bespoke parser scripts supported by coding agents
  constraints:
    - Data quality inconsistency across tools and teams.
    - Large incident corpora requiring efficient parsing.
    - Need for executive-level clarity without losing technical detail.
  tradeoffs:
    - Highly automated reporting improves speed but needs governance checks.
    - Deep parser analysis increases insight quality but requires stronger maintenance.

lessons_learned:
  - Governance and taxonomy alignment are prerequisites for trustworthy dashboards.
  - Parsing strategy must balance speed, maintainability, and traceability.
  - Executive communication improves when metrics and narrative are co-designed.
improve_next:
  - Add near-real-time alerting for high-risk incident trend shifts.
  - Add quality gates for parser output validation.
  - Add scenario simulation views for proactive Change Management planning.
