one_line_value: Domain-specialized RAG system targeting high-precision, citation-backed tax guidance for professionals.
icon: rag
tags:
  - Specialized RAG
  - Citation Fidelity
  - Professional Workflow
impact_bullets:
  - Designed for high-precision answers in expert tax contexts.
  - Citation-backed outputs improve professional trust and reviewability.
  - Progressing toward beta testing with tax professionals.
executive_summary:
  problem: Tax professionals need highly precise, source-grounded answers where factual errors and missing citations carry significant risk.
  solution: Built JTES as a domain-specialized RAG system with professional workflow controls, emphasizing retrieval quality and citation-backed response generation.
  outcome: Established a beta-ready foundation focused on precision, transparent sourcing, and practitioner-oriented usability.
use_case:
  summary: Professional tax workflows require fast yet defensible answers that can be checked against source materials.
  stakeholders:
    - Tax professionals and advisors
    - Compliance and review stakeholders
    - Product owners preparing beta validation
architecture:
  overview: Domain documents are chunked and indexed, retrieval is tuned for precision, and generated answers include explicit citations and review cues.

tech_details:
  rag_prompt_patterns:
    - Citation-required answer schema with source references.
    - Retrieval-first prompting before synthesis to reduce hallucinations.
    - Clarification prompts when source confidence is insufficient.
  tools:
    - Domain document ingestion and indexing pipeline
    - Retrieval tuning for professional query patterns
    - Evaluation harness for precision and citation checks
  constraints:
    - High-stakes domain requires conservative answer behavior.
    - Source freshness and jurisdiction nuance must be explicit.
    - Precision goals can increase response latency.
  tradeoffs:
    - Tighter citation requirements improve trust but limit response breadth.
    - Conservative refusal behavior reduces risk but can frustrate exploratory users.

  - Domain SMEs are critical for meaningful offline evaluation.
improve_next:
  - Expand benchmark set with adversarial tax scenarios.
  - Add stronger freshness controls for source updates.
  - Add per-answer evidence sufficiency scoring.
repro:
  runnable: false
  steps:
