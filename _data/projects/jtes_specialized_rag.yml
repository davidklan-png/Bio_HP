tech_details:
  rag_prompt_patterns:
    - Ask in Japanese or English; retrieve and synthesize from Japanese official tax/legal sources.
    - Return answers with explicit citations tied to official NTA and e-Gov materials.
    - Apply fail-closed behavior when citation verification does not pass.
    - Support temporal legal research for past laws and regulation changes.
  tools:
    - Tax AI Advisor (税務AIアドバイザー)
    - Regulatory Monitoring (法令モニタリング)
    - Legal Research & Comparison (法令比較リサーチ)
    - Multi-Tenant Platform (マルチテナントプラットフォーム)
  constraints:
    - Japanese tax and accounting terminology is preserved to avoid meaning loss from subjective translation.
    - Source grounding is limited to official data such as 国税庁 (NTA) and e-Gov.
    - Professional use requires conservative behavior when evidence is missing.
    - Precision may be higher for Japanese queries because primary laws are authored in Japanese.
  tradeoffs:
    - Strict citation requirements improve trust but can reduce response coverage.
    - Fail-closed behavior reduces speculative risk but may withhold answers when evidence is insufficient.
    - Temporal monitoring and comparison features add operational value with added system complexity.
