name: Receipt Classification & Matching System
one_line_value: Automated statement-to-receipt reconciliation for faster, cleaner tax submission workflows.
icon: receipt
tags:
  - Document AI
  - Expense Operations
  - Classification
impact_bullets:
  - Reduced manual receipt matching and exception triage effort.
  - Improved categorization consistency for tax-ready reporting.
  - Added ambiguity handling for difficult vendor names.
executive_summary:
  problem: Credit card statements and receipts were reconciled manually, creating delays and inconsistent categorization before company tax submission.
  solution: Built a Gemini Colab workflow using free LLMs to match statement lines to receipts, then classify transactions with ambiguity-aware vendor handling.
  outcome: Delivered a repeatable review flow that speeds reconciliation and produces cleaner, tax-oriented expense categorization.
use_case:
  summary: Finance and operations teams need reliable monthly transaction matching and categorization without scaling manual review time.
  stakeholders:
    - Finance operations analysts
    - Accounting and tax preparers
    - Business managers submitting expenses
architecture:
  overview: Statement rows and receipt text are normalized, candidate matches are scored, and ambiguous vendors are sent through LLM-assisted classification before final review.

tech_details:
  rag_prompt_patterns:
    - Prompted ambiguity resolver with vendor-name and merchant-context hints.
    - Structured output template for category labels and confidence.
    - Lightweight fallback rules when model confidence drops.
  tools:
    - Gemini Colab notebook runtime
    - Python data cleaning and matching logic
    - Free LLM endpoints for classification support
  constraints:
    - Inconsistent receipt quality and OCR noise.
    - Merchant aliases and truncated statement descriptors.
    - Limited budget for model/API usage.
  tradeoffs:
    - Higher recall matching can increase false positives in edge cases.
    - More aggressive categorization automation reduces manual effort but requires tighter audit checks.

lessons_learned:
  - Confidence thresholds and review queues are essential for finance trust.
  - Merchant alias dictionaries dramatically improve initial matching quality.
  - Prompt schema enforcement prevents downstream parsing issues.
improve_next:
  - Add active-learning loops from reviewer corrections.
  - Add document-level anomaly detection for missing receipts.
  - Add monthly quality scorecards by category and vendor type.
repro:
  runnable: false
  steps:
    - Open the notebook flow and review sample statement/receipt inputs.
    - Walk through matching score logic and ambiguity classifier prompts.
    - Inspect exception-routing outputs and final categorized export format.
