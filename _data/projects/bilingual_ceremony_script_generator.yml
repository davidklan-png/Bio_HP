name: Bilingual Ceremony Script Generator (NotebookLM Collaboration)
one_line_value: Produced grounded Japanese/English ceremony scripts with strong style control and iterative refinement.
icon: bilingual
tags:
  - Grounded Generation
  - Human-in-the-Loop
  - Style Control
impact_bullets:
  - Used 10 prior scripts as grounding corpus for consistent quality.
  - Generated theme-faithful bilingual output for an Ancient Grecian concept.
  - Reduced rewriting time with collaborative iteration cycles.
executive_summary:
  problem: Ceremony script drafting required fast bilingual output while preserving tone and consistency with prior successful ceremonies.
  solution: Built a grounded generation process in NotebookLM, anchored to 10 prior scripts, then iterated with human review to tune style and bilingual fluency.
  outcome: Delivered tailored Japanese/English ceremony drafts aligned to the Ancient Grecian theme with improved consistency and editorial efficiency.
use_case:
  summary: Content planners needed high-quality bilingual scripts without sacrificing authenticity, ceremony flow, or stylistic coherence.
  stakeholders:
    - Event planning leads
    - Ceremony script reviewers
    - Bilingual MC and production teams
architecture:
  overview: Prior script corpus is used as grounding context, a themed prompt controls tone and structure, and reviewers iterate until final script acceptance.

tech_details:
  rag_prompt_patterns:
    - Grounding prompts that cite prior script motifs and structure.
    - Style-control blocks for theme, pace, and ceremonial language.
    - Iterative critique prompts to tighten bilingual consistency.
  tools:
    - NotebookLM collaborative workspace
    - Prompt templates for style and grounding checks
    - Manual editorial checkpoints for quality assurance
  constraints:
    - Need to preserve nuance across Japanese and English.
    - Theme-specific language can drift without tight constraints.
    - Output quality depends on source corpus relevance.
  tradeoffs:
    - Strong style constraints improve consistency but can reduce creative variation.
    - Faster generation cycles can increase reviewer burden if grounding is weak.

lessons_learned:
  - Grounding quality matters more than prompt verbosity.
  - Side-by-side bilingual checks catch tone drift early.
  - Human review cadence should be planned as part of the generation workflow.
improve_next:
  - Add automated terminology consistency checks across both languages.
  - Add rubric-based scoring for ceremony rhythm and readability.
  - Add reusable style packs for different ceremony themes.
repro:
  runnable: false
  steps:
    - Load a curated corpus of prior scripts and define style constraints.
    - Run initial grounded generation and compare outputs by prompt variant.
    - Review and revise with bilingual checkpoints before finalization.
